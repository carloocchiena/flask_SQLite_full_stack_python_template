# Flask SQLite full-stack-Python template

## About

A web app in Flask that allows via web form to enter a username.<br> 
The backend saves it with the date of the day and an auto-incrementing ID and saves it to a local SQLite DB.
With admin panel you can retrieve all the users.

Very basic app just for learning purposes.
